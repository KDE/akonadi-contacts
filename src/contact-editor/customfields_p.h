/**
 * @short A class that represents non-standard contact fields.
 *
 * There exists three scopes of fields. To the local scope belong all
 * custom fields that are defined by the user and that exists only for one
 * contact. The description for these fields are stored inside ContactMetaData
 * as custom attribute of the Akonadi item that represents the contact.
 * To the global scope belong all custom fields that are defined by the user but
 * shall be available in all contacts of the address book. Their description
 * is stored by CustomFieldManager in $HOME/.kde/share/config/akonadi_contactrc.
 * All other custom fields belong to the external scope, they come with import
 * of contacts from other PIM applications (e.g. further X- entries in vCards).
 * Their description is created on the fly when editing the custom fields.
 *
 * The description of a custom field covers the key, title and type.
