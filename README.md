# Akonadi Contacts #

Akonadi Contacts is a library that effectively bridges the type-agnostic API of
the Akonadi client libraries and the domain-specific KContacts library. It provides
jobs, models and other helpers to make working with contacts and addressbooks through
Akonadi easier.

The library provides a complex dialog for editing contacts and several models to
list and filter contacts.
